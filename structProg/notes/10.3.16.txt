Theorem: all expressions contain a constant (c) or a variable (x)

Inductive Hypothesis (IH)

Proof by induction using the height of expression trees. 
Base Case: Given h = 1, E_1 \in {c, x} 
Assumes a tree E, of h > 1, contains c or x.
E_1 contians E, therefore it contains c or x.


Structural Proof
Case 1: e is a constant => e contains a constant
Case 2: e is x => e contains a var
Case 3: e is e_1 + e_2; by IH e1 and e2 contain a const or variable
Case 4: e is e_1 * e_2;
